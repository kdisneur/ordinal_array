{"name":"Ordinal array","body":"# Ordinal array\r\n\r\nOrdinal array is a Gem which allows you to access to a value of an array by an ordinal value. You can access to the first element of an array by the \"first\" method. Now you can access to the second element by \"second\", the third by \"third\" and that until the 999th elements.\r\n\r\nWorks with Ruby 1.9\r\n\r\nImprove ordinal array speed for multiple calls on the same method on the same array: (Benchmark results: https://gist.github.com/2337544)\r\n\r\nExemple:\r\n````ruby\r\nmy_array = [\"value1\", \"value2\", \"value3\"]\r\nputs my_array.third # print: value 3\r\nputs my_array.third # print: value 3 (But... much faster!)\r\n````\r\n\r\n# How to use\r\n\r\nJust add gem ``ordinal_array`` in your gemfile.\r\nIt provides you some methods on the basic array class\r\n\r\nExemple of use:\r\n\r\n````ruby\r\nmy_array = [\"value1\", \"value2\", \"value3\"]\r\nputs my_array.third # print: value 3\r\nmy_array[41] = \"it works fine\"\r\nputs my_array.fourty_second # print: it works fine\r\n````\r\n","tagline":"Allow you to use every ordinal... not just first","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
